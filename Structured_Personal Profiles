      <value>Collaborating with the Beauty Lounge Minneapolis, we have full-time nail technicians providing nail care services equipped with both stationary and mobile stations that will allow hair care clients the opportunity to maximize their appointment time and get both nails and hair done at the same time!
              I’m looking forward to embracing the Twin Cities community and grow into a larger salon space so we can continue to build upon the momentum.</value>

    <value> I love applying feelings into the design and scope of work space. When you see our new space and home in Uptown, you’ll be forced to say who wouldn’t want to get their hair and nails done here?? I’m happy to be apart of the designing phase of our expansion project.</value>
